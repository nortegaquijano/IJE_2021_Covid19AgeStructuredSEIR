# IJE_2021_CovidAgeStructuredSEIR

### Methods:
We programmed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model in order to introduce epidemiologically-relevant age classes into the outbreak dynamics analysis. The model was fitted to the official death toll and calculated age distribution of deaths in Wuhan using a constrained linear least-squares algorithm. Subsequently, we used synthetic location-specific and age-structured contact matrices to quantify the effect of age-selective interventions both on mortality and on economic activity in Wuhan. For this purpose, we simulated four different scenarios ranging from an absence of measures to age-selective interventions with stronger physical distancing measures for older individuals.
